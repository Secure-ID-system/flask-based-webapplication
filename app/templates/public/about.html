	<h1>Secure Face ID System</h1>

	<!-- <center><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icon.png')}}" width=25% display=block/></center> -->
	<p>
		As machine learning and especially computer vision becomes more ubiquitous technology, we leveraged state-of-the-art algortihms to create system for face recognition, which can be used out of the box. The system has to be populated with people's images and names. Then machine learning algorithm has to spend time for training and evaluation results. After that, the system is ready to use.

	<p>
		Make out-of-the-box solution for face recognition.  Build an iOS app which is able to capture image of a person and then match images in database, if avaliable then the user could get access to the sysytem.
